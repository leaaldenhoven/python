# Collection of Python scripts
# This repository includes scripts I wrote as part of a Python data analysis course labelled according to the progress within the course.
#
# Script1 includes code to analyse data on sign-ups for an online course. Specifically, the dataset includes when people enrolled, how much they engaged in the course per day and whether and when they submitted a final project for the course. The Python code cleans up the data and answers questions of interest including:
# 1) How many students are enrolled in the programme?
# 2) How many accounts are simply test files (and can be removed)?
# 3) How many students continued past the free trial?
# 4) How many people pass each lesson?
#
# Script2 describes with how to use NumPy and Pandas to make code shorter and quicker and process data more easily. While in the beginning, specific research questions are generated for a particular dataset on countries' employment, GDP and schooling, the rest of the script serves like a library for reference on how to use numpy and pandas.
# 
# Script3 follows up on the numpy/pandas library. Here I aimed to visualise changes in the percentage of girls going through schooling to identify whether there werer any sudden changes, e.g. due to changes in policy.
#
# Script4 uses more advanced numpy and pandas procedures to deal with data on subway usage per weekday, including weather data in New York.
